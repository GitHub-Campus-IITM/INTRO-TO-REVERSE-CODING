# Post Event Report [Introduction to Reverse Coding] [2021/12/05]

## Attendance :dancers:

63 people joined the meeting including the presenter and organizer. So the attendance went much more than we expected.

## Venue :school:

We chose Microsoft teams to host the session. It was my first time using this, so I felt a little uncomfortable. But I now learnt how to use this. I'll fix all the problems I faced this time

## Planning vs Implementation :paperclip:

The meeting started at 7:45 exactly as scheduled. At the end we continued some chit chats with some attendees, so it went longer than we expected, but the main event went on time, we ended the main part at 8:40.



## Positives :+1:

* The attendance didn't fall with time. We hold almost a constant number of people attending the session throughout the whole time.
* We got a lot more participation than we expected.

## Negatives :-1:

* The program was a little fast it seems.

## Feedback from Attendees :speech_balloon:

*Feel free to use quotes, lists, screen shots - whatever makes it easiest to share the info (please make sure you have permission to use a person's comments).* 

*Tell us how you got the feedback too - was it done during the event at the end, comments made on social media/community channels or did you put out any formal feedback forms etc.?*

## Summary :thought_balloon:

This was a quick and brief session as we planned it. It was really informative, and [Dhruv Maroo](https://github.com/DMaroo) delivered the content too well. Thanks to him to bring the session to the best possible.
